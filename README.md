# test_ship_yolov5
This repository was created for a trained model on yolov5. Model was trained to detect ships from satellite images.
All the work was done in JupyterLab.

This repository contains 2 folders 'yolov5' and 'test_data' and ship_detect.ipynb
'test_data' file contains all the necessary dataset for training and testing the model.
'yolov5' contains files for working with the model.
ship_detect.ipynb this is a file with the code.

In this path "MY_TEST_SHIP/yolov5/runs/train/" are all the results of training models.
There were 4 trainings in total. With different parameters.

"MY_TEST_SHIP/yolov5/runs/detect/" Here test results = model training results. But starting from result_detect4 and further in order, the test results relate exclusively to the 4 trained models, but with different test parameters.
